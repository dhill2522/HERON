HERON is primarily a Python framework and as such follows [PEP8 standards](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
with the following exceptions:
 - Indentation is done using increments of two whitespaces (PEP8 suggests 4)

Specific details are on the wiki, [Coding Standards](https://github.com/idaholab/HERON/wiki/Coding-Standards)

To maintain quality assurance, development in HERON is issue-driven; that is,
new development should be based on resolving a submitted issue (task or defect).
New development ideally should not be commenced until at least one associated
issue has been reviewed (via the Issue Review checklist) and approved for
development by the Change Control Board (CCB).

New development is performed either on development branches using
a developer's fork of HERON. To merge
developments into the main `devel` branch, a merge request is created
referencing the issue that incited the development, and a review performed by
a member of the CCB (via the Change Request Review checklist).
