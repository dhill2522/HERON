\section{ Installation and how to run}

\subsection{Installation}
As a plugin of RAVEN, HERON is installed as a submodule. RAVEN maintains up-to-date instructions for
plugin installation in its documentation
(\href{https://github.com/idaholab/raven/wiki/Plugins}{see the link to the Raven plugin
installation}.

\subsection{How to run}
Directly running HERON through RAVEN has not finished implementation. To run HERON, use bash to
run the executable:
\begin{lstlisting}
  /path/to/HERON/heron my_heron_input.xml
\end{lstlisting}
replacing
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{/path/to/HERON} with your path to the HERON repository; and
  \item \texttt{my\_heron\_input.xml} with your HERON XML input.
\end{itemize}
For example, if my HERON is located as a submodule of RAVEN in \texttt{~/projects/raven}, and I
wanted to run the integration test \texttt{production\_flex}, I could do the following:
\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\footnotesize]
  cd ~/projects/raven/plugins/HERON/tests/integration_tests/production_flex
  ~/projects/raven/plugins/HERON/heron heron_input.xml
\end{lstlisting}
Alternatively, you can use Python to run \texttt{HERON/src/main.py} with the HERON XML input as
argument; however, this will bypass loading the \texttt{raven\_libraries} and other initialization.
